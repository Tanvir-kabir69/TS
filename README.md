# ðŸ”— Interfaces vs Types in TypeScript: What You Need to Know

TypeScript, a powerful superset of JavaScript, brings type safety and robust tooling to modern web development. Among its key features are interface and type, both of which allow you to describe the shape of data. While they may seem interchangeable at first glance, understanding their differences can help you write cleaner, more maintainable, and future-proof code.

Letâ€™s dive into the differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript, along with when to use each.


## âœ…  1. Declaration and Extension
#### Interface

```javascript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```
Interfaces are designed to describe the shape of objects. They support declaration merging, which means you can define the same interface in multiple places and TypeScript will combine them.

#### Type

```javascript
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```
Type aliases do not support declaration merging. Once a type is declared, it cannot be reopened.

## ðŸ”„ 2. Extending Another Structure
#### Interface

```javascript
interface Employee extends Person {
  department: string;
}
```

#### Type

```javascript
type Employee = Person & {
  department: string;
};
```
Both can be extended, but interfaces use extends while types use intersection (&). For object shapes, both are valid, but interfaces offer a more semantic and readable approach when working with object inheritance.


## ðŸŽ­ 3. Use Cases Beyond Objects
#### Interface

Interfaces are object-only â€” they canâ€™t represent primitive types or unions.

#### Type

```javascript
type ID = string | number;
type Position = [number, number];
```
Types can describe primitive types, tuples, unions, intersections, and more.


## ðŸ’¥ 4. Compatibility and Performance

Interfaces are generally preferred by the TypeScript team for public APIs and libraries because:

- They're more performant in large codebases.
- They provide better error messages and tooling support in many IDEs.

However, types are more flexible and often useful for internal use, especially when complex union/intersection types are needed.


## ðŸ§  5. Which One Should You Use?

#### Interface

Extending object shapes, Working with classes, Declaration merging needed

#### Type

Complex unions or intersections, Primitive aliasing, Lightweight and quick modeling


## ðŸ”š Conclusion

Both interface and type are essential tools in a TypeScript developerâ€™s toolkit. While they overlap in many scenarios, the choice depends on the context:

- Use interface for defining object shapes and when working with OOP-like structures.
- Use type when you need unions, intersections, or working with non-object types.

By leveraging the strengths of both, you can write more expressive and robust TypeScript code.
